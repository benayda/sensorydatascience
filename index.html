<p>We aim to enhance the quality of people's lives by applying the techniques and methodologies of Cognitive Computing and Data Science to Sensory Science.</p>
<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, there are than 200,000 people in the U.S. who seek help from their doctors each year to deal with taste and smell problems. Many more people are unhappily living with taste or smell problems without seeking medical help, with estimates of up to 15 percent of American adults facing this unfortunate situation every day.
  See: https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/taste-disorders</p>
<p></p>
<p> We are very concerned, knowing many adults who have lost the pleasure of eating and who can't figure out what to eat that will taste even just okay. 
  And we are very concerned, knowing other adults who are trying their best to make sure their loved ones eat a healthy diet but who are at a loss as to what to cook for their loved ones with taste disorders.
  We see many adults eating more salt or sugar than is healthy for them, hoping to improve the taste of their food.
  And the problem is only getting worse - with 10,000 adults/day turning 65 in the U.S. alone, and people starting to lose their taste buds after the age of 50, 
  with many adults taking medications or undergoing treatments like chemotherapy or radiation particularly to the head and neck, that affect their sense of taste. 
          </p>  
  
  Frustrated with the current situation, we decided to use the tools of Cognitive Computing and Data Science to address this problem.</p>
  
 <p>We are currently developing a Personalized Flavor Guide to help people figure out what to make and eat that is both healthy and tasty based on their own individual needs and preferences.</p>

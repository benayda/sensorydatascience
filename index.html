<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Sensory Data Science</h3>

<p>We aim to enhance the quality of people's lives by applying the techniques and methodologies of Cognitive Computing and Data Science to Sensory Science.</p>
<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, there are more than 200,000 people in the U.S. who seek help from their doctors each year to deal with taste and smell problems. 
  Many more people are unhappily living with taste or smell problems without seeking medical help, with estimates of up to 15 percent of American adults facing this unfortunate situation every day.
  For more information, please see <a href=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/taste-disorders>Taste Disorders.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p> We are very concerned, knowing many adults, who having lost the pleasure of eating, are now struggling to figure out what is merely tolerable to eat. 
  And we are very concerned, knowing many other adults, who are trying their best to make sure their loved ones eat a healthy diet but who are at a loss as to what to cook.
  In an attempt to improve the taste of their food or to just taste something, we see many adults eating much more salt or sugar than is healthy for them, causing more problems.
  And we see others who aren't eating enough to maintain a healthy weight since food just doesn't taste good anymore.
  </p>
          
 <p>With 10,000 adults turning 65 each day in the U.S. alone, recognizing the fact that adults usually start losing taste buds after the age of 50,
  the problem is only getting worse. And the problem is compounded by the fact that many of these adults are taking medications
   or undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation particularly to the head and neck, that can adversely affect their sense of taste.
          </p>  
  
<p>Frustrated with the current situation, we have decided to build a Personalized Flavor Guide, combining Cognitive Computing and 
Data Science tools with our experience developing gerontechnology solutions. Our approach is to apply technology to empower people,
developing solutions that improve the quality of their lives. For more information on our completed gerontechnology projects, 
please see the final reports we submitted to the National Institutes of Health: 
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benayda/sensorydatascience/master/reports/1R41AG035452-01_NIH-NIA-STTR-Final_Report.pdf">
    Sensor-Enabled Elder Social Support Platform </a>
and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benayda/sensorydatascience/master/reports/1R41AG037216-01_NIA-STTR-Final.pdf">
  Online Psychosocial Assessment Instruments.</a></p>
  
  <p>The Personalized Flavor Guide will help people 
  figure out what to make and eat that is both tasty and healthy, based on their own individual needs and preferences.</p>
